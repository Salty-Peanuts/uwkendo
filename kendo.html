                            <p><b>Etiquette and Manner</b></p>

                            <p>
                            In kendo, we have high expectations on your etiquette and manner.
                            The doujo is the place where you practice and you should pay 
                            respect to it.
                            Before a practice,
                            your shoes should be lined up neatly outside of the doujo.
                            When you enter or leave the doujo, you should do a bow.
                            Always have a clean rag ready and be prepared to clean the doujo floor.
                            During practice, show respect to your peers
                            and demonstrate good spirit with kiai.
                            Respect your sword and carry it properly using your left hand.
                            Never let the tip of the sword hit the floor.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Equipment</b></p>

                            <p>
                            In kendo, you will be using a bamboo sword (shinai) for practice.
                            The Gi is the top uniform and the Hakama is the bottom uniform.
                            We also use a bogu (the protective gear) for sparring.
                            The head gear is called men and
                            the hand gear is called kote. 
                            Do note that beginners should not purchase any equipment without
                            permission from an instructor.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Matches</b></p>

                            <p>
                            A standard kendo match has a time limit of three minutes.
                            The side that first scores two points wins the match.
                            There are usually three judges (one as the head judge).
                            A point can be scored by gaining a majority vote from the
                            judges. In the case where there is a tie,
                            either judges will decide the winner or a time limit
                            extension will be given.
                            </p>
