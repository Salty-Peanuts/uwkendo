					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="row">
						<section class="special">
							<button class="accordion">Do I need experience to join?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>Nope! We welcome absolute beginners who are interested in kendo. We will teach you starting from the very basics. We accept beginners at the start of every school term in September and January and hold trial practices the week after Clubs Day (usually the second week of classes).</p>
								</div>

								<button class="accordion">Do I need to buy the equipment, and if so, where?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>As a beginner, you do not need to buy bogu (the protective gear), however you will be required to buy a shinai (50$). Eventually, as you get more advanced, you might start thinking of investing in a bogu set of your own; however, initially you can borrow from the club.</p>
								</div>	

								<button class="accordion">How much does it cost?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>Membership fee is 35$ per term, and the shinai costs 50$. For both the membership and shinai it costs 70$.</p>
								</div>

								<button class="accordion">Do I need to be a student to join?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>As a University of Waterloo Club, it is required that you are a student or faculty member in order to join. If you are still interested in practicing kendo, we encourage you to take a look at the Cambridge Kendo Club.</p>
								</div>

								<button class="accordion">Can I drop in to a class?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								  <p>Yes, you may drop in to view a class. If you are interested in joining and are a beginner, we accept new people at the start of each term.</p>
